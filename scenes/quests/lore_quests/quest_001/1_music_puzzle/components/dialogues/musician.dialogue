	StoryWeaver: I kicked them and something strange happened...
Musician: These stones? They're part of a magical song that used to open the portal to the Ink Well, where songwriters found ink to write their songs. But...
Musician: Um... Anyway, now I can only recall the first few notes of the magical melody. The rest slips away.
StoryWeaver: Can you show me what you remember? Maybe I can help.
